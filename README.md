# slideshow-on-oled
This program is not inspired by a regular slideshow; it draws inspiration from the beautifully curated product demos of appliances and products having a display unit, such as digital pianos and workstations (music enthusiasts would know!).
If you want to demonstrate an idea through a project or a prototype, an OLED display is all you need to show its features in style. Oh, and the code that drives it.
This was part of an electronics project that implemented a bare-metal operating system; the slideshow was meant to show the features of the product and was an option on its main menu, a fruit of days and nights of hard work.
It is hoped that this repo benefits students and working professionals alike.
