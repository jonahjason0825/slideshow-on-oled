# slideshow-on-oled
This program is not a regular slideshow; it draws inspiration from the beautifully curated product demos of appliances and products having a display unit, such as digital pianos and workstations (music enthusiasts would know!).
If you want to demonstrate an idea through a project or a prototype, an OLED display is all you need to show its features in style. Oh, and the code that drives it. It supports Arduino Uno, ESP 12-E, and ESP 32 (would be glad to know if you could add to the list!).
This was part of an electronics project that implemented a bare-metal operating system; the slideshow was meant to show the features of the product and was an option on its main menu.
Included is a sample image.

It is hoped that this repo benefits students and working professionals alike.
